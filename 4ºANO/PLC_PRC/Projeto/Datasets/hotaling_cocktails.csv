Vermouth will last about 3-4 months. There are many producers of vermouth, all varying in style and flavor, so we would recommend trying a couple out and finding which you prefer. It's also fun to taste the difference. This goes for both dry (French) and sweet (Italian). Depending on the type you use, you might want to adjust the quantities used in your cocktail to your liking.

Apricot brandy: There are many brands out there. We like to use the Rothman & Winter. Unlike other fruit liqueurs that can be cloyingly sweet, the Rothman & Winter delivers a sweetness and bouquet expected when enjoying a fresh apricot.

This is a nice cocktail for vodka martini drinkers that want a little twist on their cocktail. It's essentially a perfect martini made with vodka and apricot brandy."

The original cocktail was created by a bartender at The Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans. Though this drink may have been derived from a traditional vermouth cocktail created in the mid-1800s, many people who encounter the Vieux Carré today will equate it to a Manhattan variation, served on the rocks.

This new or ""Nieux"" version is a little nuttier and lighter in body. The nutty flavors of the sherry brandy really play off the savory earthy notes of the Karlsson's Gold Vodka. Enjoy this cocktail with some cheese or as an after dinner drink. It is perfect in front of a fireplace."

Second being Lemon, Esprit de June, and Seltzer. The three ingredients used in the cocktail to complement the Karlsson's Vodka."
