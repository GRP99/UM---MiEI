## Swagger
<p> Through EHR-management, we can manage EHRs, the directory FOLDER resource and CONTRIBUTION resources. However, to access them they need clear documentation.
<p> In order to solve this problem was used <a href="http://localhost:2021/api-docs/"><i>Swagger UI</i></a> that is the largest framework for designing APIs using a common language and enabling the development across the whole API lifecycle, including documentation, design, testing, and deployment.
