Context:
	SQLite is a self-contained, file-based SQL database. SQLite comes bundled with Python and can be used in any of your Python applications without having to install any additional software.
	SQLite is often the technology of choice for small applications, particularly those of embedded systems and devices like phones and tablets, smart appliances, and instruments.
	Provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesnâ€™t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.
Install:
	You don't need to install sqlite3 module. It is included in the standard library (since Python 2.5).
	You can also check the documentation by executing $ pydoc sqlite3
Import:
	import sqlite3
Connection and Cursors over Connections:
	con = sqlite3.connect('teste.db')
	
We can also use sqlite3 as command interpreter. As well for storing data without python -> Create Tables.
Pros - Ease of use

     - Brings data consistency and structure
     - Advantages of SQL are implicit here (SQL language pe)
Cons
