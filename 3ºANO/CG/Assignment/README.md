# Practical Assignment

## Goal
The goal of this assignment was to develop a mini scene graph based 3D engine and provide usage examples that show its potential. The assignment was split in four phases, each with a due date as specified below.

1. [Phase 1](Phase1/) – Graphical primitives
2. [Phase 2](Phase2/) – Geometric Transforms
3. [Phase 3](Phase3/) – Curves, Cubic Surfaces and VBOs
4. [Phase 4](Phase4/) – Normals and Texture Coordinates
