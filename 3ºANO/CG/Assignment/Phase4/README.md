# Phase 4 â€“ Normals and Texture Coordinates
In this phase the geometry generator application should generate texture coordinates and normals for each vertex.

In the 3D engine we must activate the lighting and texturing functionalities, as well as read and apply the normals and texture coordinates from the model files.
